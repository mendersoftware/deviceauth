      summary: Submit an authentication request
      description: |
        Issues an authentication token for use in device-facing API calls.

        The device presents its unique identity data and public key, and signs the request with its private key.
        If the request is valid and the device is known to the system, a valid JWT authentication token is issued.

        Note that the very first authentication request from a given device ('bootstrap' request) always
        results in 'HTTP 401 Unauthorized'. At the same time, the identity data is recorded for
        later inspection by the user, who then explicitly accepts or rejects the device via the web GUI (backed by
        the Device Admission Service). A subsequent authentication request will reflect this decision.

        Note that in case of JWT expiration, the authentication request must be sent again.

          description: |
            Authentication successful - a new JWT is issued and returned.
            The JWT is signed with the API's private key ('RS256' signing algorithm), and contains
            the following standard claims:
            * 'iss' - issuer
            * 'exp' - expiry date
            * 'sub' - subject (auto-generated device ID)
            * 'jti' - token's unique identifier (tracked for the purpose of revocation)

                The device cannot be granted authentication. There are multiple possible reasons, e.g.:
                * the device hasn't been accepted yet
                * the device has been explicitly rejected
                * key/signature don't match
